## Short Description
**Guitar Glitch** is a browser-based rhythm game inspired by Guitar Hero.  
Built with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, it challenges players to hit notes in time with the music using their keyboard.  

Choose your difficulty, test your timing skills, and aim for the highest score!

## Key Features
- **Song Selection:** Play along to two available songs.  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Three modes (Easy, Medium, Hard) â€“ higher difficulty = more accurate note patterns.  
- **Keyboard Controls:** Use your keyboard to hit the notes in rhythm.  
- **Timing System:** Points are awarded based on precision â€“ the better the timing, the higher the score.  
- **Note Mapping:** Notes are pre-programmed with JSON and time delay for accurate synchronization.  
- **Score Feedback:** Track your performance and aim for the best possible score.  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Game Logic:** Custom JSON note-mapping with timing delays  
- **Audio:** Native browser audio playback  
- **Styling:** CSS (custom game UI)

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- **Rhythm Synchronization:** Learned how to synchronize visual note drops with audio playback using delays and timestamps.  
- **JSON Note Mapping:** Built a system to define and load note patterns for different songs and difficulties.  
- **Keyboard Input Handling:** Implemented precise keyboard event detection and timing windows for scoring.  
- **Game Design Balance:** Discovered how difficulty scaling impacts gameplay flow and user engagement.

## Notes
This project was created as part of my **Frontend Developer training at Cimdata**.  
The main focus was on JavaScript game logic, timing precision, and JSON-based note mapping.
Further improvements could include additional songs, expanded difficulty settings, and advanced animations.

### Future Improvements
- Add additional songs  
- Expand difficulty settings  
- Implement advanced animations  
- Explore mobile support (e.g., touch controls or on-screen buttons)  

### Known Bugs
- **Audio Delay on First Start:** The audio may start slightly delayed on the very first run because the file isnâ€™t fully loaded. After the first start, everything remains in sync.  

> Currently, the game is **keyboard-only** and **not optimized for mobile devices**.
